# Open Issues

Open findings from code work that are not fixed yet. Each issue is a self-contained file; once it is fixed and
verified, delete the file and its row here (see `AGENTS.md` → *Documentation and Issues*). Keep this README with its
table even when no issues are open.

Every row has a severity and a size; keep the table ordered by severity (High, Medium, Low), then by size (S, M, L).

- **Severity:** High = wrong results or lost/corrupted data; Medium = a feature fails or misleads, with a workaround;
  Low = no user-visible effect, or only inconvenience.
- **Size:** S = a local change of a few lines with a test; M = several classes or a migration; L = spread over many
  modules or needs a design decision.

| Issue | Severity | Size | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [The command line ends with OK although data was lost](cli-write-errors-exit-code.md) | Low | S | Write errors do not change the exit code |
| [A failed recovery deletes the project-file lock file](failed-recovery-deletes-lock-file.md) | Low | S | A rare race between instances on the same project file |
